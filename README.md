# Prisoners Dilemma

I figured it would be fun to build a script that can put two 'prisoners' against each other, where the prisoners are coded by the contestants. Tried make it modular and generic so I can reuse this code to make it run different 'games'.  
For now the players have to be provided during the initialisation, but I'd like to make them load dynamically in the future and run them in sandboxed environments.
